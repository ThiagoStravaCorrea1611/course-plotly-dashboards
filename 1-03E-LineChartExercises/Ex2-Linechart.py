# Objective: Using the file 2010YumaAZ.csv, develop a Line Chart
# that plots seven days worth of temperature data on one graph.
# You can use a for loop to assign each day to its own trace.
######

# Perform imports here:
import pandas as pd
import plotly.offline as pyo
import plotly.graph_objs as go



# Create a pandas DataFrame from 2010YumaAZ.csv
df = pd.read_csv('../data/2010YumaAZ.csv')
days = ['TUESDAY','WEDNESDAY','THURSDAY','FRIDAY','SATURDAY','SUNDAY','MONDAY']


# Use a for loop (or list comprehension to create traces for the data list)
data = [go.Scatter(
    x=df[df['DAY'] == day].LST_TIME,
    y=df[df['DAY'] == day].T_HR_AVG,
    mode='lines',
    name=day) for day in days]

# Define the layout
layout = go.Layout(
    title='Line Charts')

# Create a fig from data and layout, and plot the fig
fig = go.Figure(
    data=data,
    layout=layout)

pyo.plot(fig,
         filename = 'my_solution2a.html')
